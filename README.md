This project is a workout generator and workout tracker.
It is created using react.js, sass, node.js, and express.js.
The project was created using a mobile-first design strategy and is fully responsive. It utilizes accessibility styling principles and has some effects and animations as well.
You can click on a muscle group button to generate workouts for that muscle group. This is done through an api call to the JSON file in the back end I created.
On the workout tracker page, you may log and delete workouts.
